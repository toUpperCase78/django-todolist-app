# Django To-Do-List App

**The fully-functional to-do-list application with Python Django**

## Overview

This to-do-list project was created with **Python** language and **Django** framework (v5.1.1), which enables to simulate the well-known **to-do-list** application.

To carry out this project into runnable condition at the most reasonable level, I benefited from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm1mokevMWk) by "Tech with Tim", teaching Django with various aspects and took more than 3 hours to complete.

Thanks to the video for elaborating the necessary components about Django, this project features these things below:

* SQLite3 Database
* Admin Dashboard
* Templates & Custom HTML
* Simple & Custom Forms
* Sidebar
* Bootstrap CSS
* User Registration
* Login, Logout & User Authentication
* User Specific Pages

Later on, I continued working on this project, such as providing richer UI, enabling item deletion from to-do lists, more robust user registry, and login / logout procedure.

_Hopefully, this will pave the way for creating web applications using Python & Django with other popular libraries alongside, for unique user experience and interactions and being alternative to other web frameworks such as React, TypeScript, etc._
