# Django To-Do-List App

**The fully-functional to-do-list application with Python Django**

## Overview

This to-do-list project was created with **Python** language and **Django** framework (v5.1.1), which enables to simulate the well-known **to-do-list** application.

To carry out this project into runnable condition at the most reasonable level, I benefited from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm1mokevMWk), teaching Django with various aspects and took more than 3 hours to complete.

Thanks to the video for elaborating the necessary components about Django, this project features these things below:

* SQLite3 Database
* Admin Dashboard
* Templates & Custom HTML
* Simple & Custom Forms
* Sidebar
* Bootstrap CSS
* User Registration
* Login, Logout & User Authentication
* User Specific Pages

Later on, I continued working on this project, such as providing richer UI, enabling item deletion from to-do lists, more robust user registry, and login / logout procedure.

_Hopefully, this will pave the way for creating web applications using Python & Django with other popular libraries alongside, for unique user experience and interactions and being alternative to other web frameworks such as React, TypeScript, etc._

## Usage



## Available Users

There are total of 5 users registered in this project beforehand with different permissions:

* **YigitNewday** (as seen above) is the **superuser**; has all the permissions in the admin page and is able to change all the to-do-lists and items inside, as well as the users.
* **Damon863** is another user with **staff** permission; he's able to access the admin page, but does not have the ability to change everything.
* The rest of the users are **Andrew984**, **Betty725** and **Charlie476**; being the normal active users with no additional permissions.

You can also try logging in with these users to see the permission differences; all these users are using the same password: `django123456`
